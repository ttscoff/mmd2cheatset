#### Actions 

You press a key on a keyboard or tap a key on a Multi-Touch screen; you type a character, word, or phrase. In general, don't use articles and the word key in references to keys. Ease the user into this construction by using the and key the first time you mention a keystroke. 

> _First occurrence:_ Press the Control key. 
> _Thereafter:_ Press Control. 
 
#### Modifier keys

Capitalize the names of modifier keys. 

> Control key, Option key, Shift key, Command key, Esc key

#### Punctuation/Nonalphanumeric Keys

When a punctuation key or nonalphanumeric key is used in a combination keystroke, or as a modifier for the word key, capitalize the key name. (However, use lowercase for punctuation marks and nonalphanumeric symbols in other contexts.)

> Option-Shift-Hyphen 
> press the Hyphen key 
> type a hyphen 

Placing the punctuation mark or symbol in parentheses after the spelled-out key name is optional, but be consistent within a document. 

> Shift-Command-Tilde (~)

#### Combination Keystrokes


In combination keystrokes, use hyphens to signify that the user should hold down the first key or keys while pressing the last key. Don't use a hyphen if each key should be pressed and released separately. Be sure to explain this convention on first use. 

> Control-Shift-N 
> Esc N

Capitalize but don't italicize or use code font for letters used as key names. 

> Command-C 
> Command-X 

If there's more than one modifier key, use this order

1. Control
2. Option
3. Shift
4. Command

When a keyboard shortcut includes a mouse or trackpad action, use lowercase for the mouse or trackpad action.

> Option-click 
> Option-swipe with three fingers

#### Two-Word Key Names


When one of the key names in a combination keystroke is two words or a hyphenated word, use en dashes where you would ordinarily use hyphens.

> Option-Right Bracket 
> Option-Command-Up Arrow 
> Option-Command-double-click 

When referring to more than one key, use the full name of each key. 

> _Correct:_ the Right Arrow or Left Arrow key 
> _Incorrect:_ the Right or Left Arrow key

#### Keys Labeled With Two Characters

When a key with two characters is used in a keyboard shortcut, identify the key by the lower of the two characters, unless the Shift key is part of the shortcut. If the Shift key is part of the keyboard shortcut, identify the key by the upper of the two characters. 

> _Correct:_ To close all stacks, press Option-Semicolon.
> _Incorrect:_ To close all stacks, press Option-Colon.
> _Correct:_ For more information, press Shift-Command-Question Mark. 
> _Incorrect:_ For more information, press Shift-Command-Slash. 

If one of the characters on the key provides a mnemonic for the action of the command, you can identify the key by that character.

To remove keyword presets 1 to 8, press Option-Shift-1 to Option-Shift-8.
When the Shift key and a key with two characters are in a combination keystroke, always show the Shift key as part of the keyboard shortcut (don't show only the upper of the two characters and assume that the user will know to press the Shift key).

> _Correct:_ To increase the Loupe diameter, press Option-Shift-Plus Sign. 
> _Incorrect:_ To increase the Loupe diameter, press Option-Plus Sign.

#### Key graphics

With graphic representations of combination keystrokes (in tables, for example), use the plus sign (+) instead of a hyphen between keys.

#### Escape and Function

Spell out the key names Escape and Function (the Fn key on portable computers and wireless keyboards) when you introduce them. In subsequent references, it's OK to abbreviate them as Esc and Fn. 

> _First occurrence:_ Press the Esc (Escape) key. 
> _Thereafter:_ Press Esc.

Don't abbreviate any other key names, except when space is very tight (in table headings, for example).
